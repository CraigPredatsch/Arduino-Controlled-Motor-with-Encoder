# Arduino-Controlled-Motor-with-Encoder

For this project, I assembled the hardware to operate a 6V DC motor that has an encoder mounted on it, and wrote the code in Arduino to operate them. Attached is the shcematic, a board diagram in Fritzing, and my Ardunio code. A video of the motor and encoder in action can be found by following the link to my Google Drive.

I created the schematic in Fritzing. The motor and encoder are attached and move together, but for a clearer schematic, I showed them as two separate components
